## Gameplay
### Missions
The missions menu can be accessed in the top navigation menu. It contains a list of all available jobs for you to do. The more missions you successfully complete, the higher your skill rating will be. Higher paying missions require a higher skill level, but are more complex with a higher risk of detection.

### Map
The map can also be accessed in the navigation menu. It displays all known devices available for you to connect to. Nodes with a dashed border are devices you have access to at least one account on, while a solid border indicates admin access. Green nodes represent devices that are involved in a mission you are currently on. Route your connection through more nodes in order to delay detection - but make sure to clear your logs!
